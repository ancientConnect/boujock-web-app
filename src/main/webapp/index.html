            Video element attributes:
            - `id="boujeeVideo"`: Added an ID for easy JavaScript targeting.
            - `autoplay`: Starts playing the video automatically as soon as it can.
            - `loop`: Makes the video repeat indefinitely.
            - `muted`: Mutes the audio. This is CRUCIAL for autoplay to work reliably across browsers,
                       as many browsers block autoplay of videos with sound without user interaction.
            - `playsinline`: Recommended for iOS devices to play video inline rather than fullscreen.
            - `class="circular-video"`: Applies the custom CSS for circular shape.

                    - `M 400 50`: Move to (start point) - This is the right side.
                    - `A 150 150`: Arc radius X and Y are 150 (making it a circular arc).
                    - `0`: x-axis-rotation (not applicable for perfect circles).
                    - `0`: large-arc-flag (0 for the smaller arc segment).
                    - `1`: sweep-flag (1 for clockwise. From (400,50) to (100,50) clockwise will curve downwards,
                           creating a 'smile' shape which is ideal for text bending below).
                    - `100 50`: End point - This is the left side.
                This path creates a curve that starts on the right, dips down in the middle, and goes up on the left.

                - `startOffset="0%"`: Starts the text at the beginning of the path.
                - `text-anchor="start"`: Aligns the start of the text to the `startOffset` point.
                This combination ensures "The" is on the right, "Boujee" curves along the bottom,
                and "Peacock" continues curving up on the left side, as requested.
